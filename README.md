Hi, welcome to a better version of the first code I introduce, this is a 
convination of html,css,bootstrap hoping to get better understanding of 
how everything works,(still work in progress).
I have multiples notes along the code to explain what I had done.
An example of them is the use of the tag style under the link of bootstrap
as follow:
<!--
   TO ADD MY EXTERNAL CSS TO BOOTSTRAP USE <link rel="stylesheet" href="your-file-css.css" /> BELOW BOOTSRTAP css or 
       as in this example add the <style> also below the css stylesheet from Bootstrap as last resurce use !importan to overwrite
       any bootstrap css you want 
       
      Make the image fully responsive
      <style>
  
      .carousel-inner img {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      }
      h1{
      text-align: center;
      text-shadow: 2px 2px #FF0000;
      }
      h3{
      color: #800000;
      text-shadow: 2px 2px #66ff66;
      }
      p{
      color: #800000;
      text-shadow: 2px 2px #66ff66;
      }
      div:hover{
      transform: rotate(360deg)
      }
      #transbutton{  
      background-color: lightblue;
      }
      #transbutton:hover{
      background-color: pink;
      transition-duration: 2s;
      }
     </style>
  -->
  However to keep the code clean I going to have it here but this is another way 
  I found to get the job done, so even if you wont see it in the code it can be 
  apply to it.
  I also follow the advise of Matt R. and created a very quick version of the logos
  I need it for this project, please excuse the poor quality since they were done
  very quick as the background covers too.
  I also found few errors in the validator, must of them I got them sort it but
  still four I'm not sure how to go around them.
  Anyway, thanks in advance for any help to who may want to make it much better.

Thank you.
